## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a new repository, Github directs you to a “new repository” form. This form allows you to define several settings of the repository, such as whether or not it is public and its name.  To clone that repository to your computer, you can either use the github app or you can clone it via the command line. 

An open source project means that an application’s source code is “open” for viewing and modification.  Any person with access to this source code can then modify it to their liking. This can produce difference features when the program runs. Usually collaboration is important for open source material. The profit is found in improvement of the product by this collaboration. Open source projects are very useful, especially in the realm of programming. You can continually improve products via tinkering and plugins allow for great personal modification. It allows for a community of developers to come together, and it is very effective in opening the door to beginners because many open source projects aren’t as complicated as professional ones. It isn’t necessarily a utopia because a lot of professional products still wind up being superior to open sourced ones, but it is a pragmatic step in building a community, opening access, and developing new ideas. Many products simply wouldn’t exist if they were not open sourced. 

Licenses are important because of an automatic copyright guarantee. Licenses allow for users to be aware of the terms of the copyright for any particular product. Because there can be small but important differences in copyright, it is useful to have licenses that adequately lay out ownership details. Thus the creator of a product can be confident in applying a proven and tested license. 

The concept of licensing as it relates to copyright was better solidified in my understanding. Usually people just say “this means anybody can use it.” without expanding on particulars. 

I haven’t found any better resources.
