## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned several things about how the web is rendered. Specifically, how servers and browsers communicate. DNS was not something I had ever looked into before. I didn't know websites had their own IP addresses. 

I suppose the important thing about html sites is to make sure everything is within a proper tag. ID's should also be unique to one element while classes can be spread out over many. I'm sure it's also important to think specifically about what tags to use for what material you're putting on site. For instance, a <div> is not the same thing as a <p>. Making a thoughtful decision at the tag level can save time later on. 

I felt good to get that .io site up. I've never had my own site. It'll be nice to have control over it. I also was never sure what a .io site was, nor did I know I could create one via github. 

The "aha" momement came when I cloned my phase_0_unit_1 repo to my computer so I could work on this reflection. Suddenly, the "flow" of everything, the way in which I can move to editing this .md file and synch it back up to github, has better revealed itself. I'm sure as I do this more often, the techniques will become more engrained, and I'll be able to build on the basics. 

The Mozilla Developer Network (http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is super helpful. Very clear references and guides. Googling has also led me to helpful posts on html5rocks.com and html5doctor.com.
