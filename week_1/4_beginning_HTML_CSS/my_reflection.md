* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The way in which html "contains" things makes a lot of sense to me. If you think about it, each element has to act as an object in some way. I guess technically they're nodes and they exist on a tree. To "read" html a browser must understand it. There has to be a simple logic behind how it is formatted and presented. For a user to see something like html, which is rendered in such a natural way, and look beyond the presentation is important. This way of looking to the underlying layers is something you have to be conscious of keeping up with. 

In all honestly, I think the difficulty of html is its bulkiness. It fills up a lot of the page with tags. You really have to have a plan of attack when it comes to presentation and spacing in order to keep it from looking sloppy and unreadable. This eats up a lot of time. 

My "aha" moment for this one came when I started to visualize the project as a whole. it's much easier to create, especially on the html level when you have a good idea of where you're taking things. You're not just pumping out paragraph elements and hoping they come together on their own. You choose your elements based on where they're going to wind up, what they're going to do. 

Indirectly related to this section, reading up on Document Object Model has been really helpful in understanding what's directly underneath the HTML structure we're exploring. Quirksmode has a really good rundown on it: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/intro.html
