* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that design is definitely structured around the material being presented. Different types of material benefit from different designs. Designs also reflect the attitude of the presenter. A comfortable publication will favor a comfortable design scheme, while news sites favor areas that focus attention. 

I like thinking about design and user experience, mostly because I find many sites frustrating, and it's enjoyable to think about what good sites do right. Designing my own site is probably the most enjoyable part of its creation. It breaks the tedious nature of coding. Also, plotting out the visuals reveals new things. Even if you have a good idea in your head of what you want a site to look like, wireframing helps build layers on the layers. It infuses creativity with logic. 

I used pen and paper to wireframe, so I didn't really look up any wireframing tools. 

A question I asked was, "How can I categorize areas by importance and what makes them important?" I wanted to go deeper than just a visual point of view. I wanted to see if the placment could reflect the personality of the creators. Could I better understand them just based on these visuals?

I enjoyed wireframing and thinking out the sites. I didn't find the material tedious. Maybe there could have been some devbootcamp specific challenge though, like analyzing a premade wireframe. I wasn't sure about how to deal with the differences between adbocked version of the sites and the ones with ads on them. I just went with the way in which I normally view them.
