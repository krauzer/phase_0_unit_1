## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I enjoyed working on the blog post for two reasons. First, it was fun to design my own blog format. There's a lot of thinking that goes into it, and even though I'm not fully satisfied with the structure right now, I know I have the ability to improve on it going forward. I'm excited to deal with more posts and unexpected additions. The simplicity of the blog structure allows for a focus on the basics. I have no idea about comments or views. That's something I have work on. 

Second, it got me really thinking about design. It was only near the end that I realized a principle behind all three websites--the difficulty of overuse--was a main reason I found each site so appealing. 

Blogging about this specific topic was a little cumbersome. By the third analysis, I felt like I was repeating myself. I would have liked to really go into detail about one website, but with three it's difficult to get into the grit. Still, two websites aren't enough to really showcase different principles, so I can see the logic behind including the third.
