# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

> Web standards are great! I like to think of web standards in the context of depreciaton. You 
> occassionaly come across some feature that has been "depreciated." Why? Why is it necessary to 
> depreciate a feature? Because we've come up with a better one or one that fits more in with the 
> current model. If we didn't have web standards we would have a bunch of outdated features. We'd 
> have models that don't fit together, and people trying to stick the old in with the new. Web 
> standards are necessary


* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

> Yes, it makes sense. The linked article on outlining was very informative. I actually enjoyed it. 
> As a tangent, I think readings like that, where a concept (one built on the material we have to 
> learn) is discussed helps me better understand the foundations that are necessary for that concept
> . It's a bit like learning by doing, but actually more like learning by thinking, as opposed to 
> learning by repetition or learning by memorizing from a bunch of slides. But anyway, when I saw 
> how outlining was laid out, it made a lot of sense to me. I had never really understood the point 
> of all those header elements. Now I see the structure and how it translates to the newer standard.> These features are crucial for things like text readers (as the author pointed out).

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

> At first I didn't. It looked like it was trying to pigeon hole you into a specific layout 
> technique. Div is less specific and thus can be interpreted as more versatile. But once I 
> understood outlining more, it made sense. And when I saw them in dev tools it was a lot easier to
> navigate through. I'm sure there's a bunch more that I don't know about which makes them better. 

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

> It's necessary because some elements come with default css styles set. reset.css is the easiest 
> way to remove them, so you can work with a blank slate. 

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

> I've used Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE. Yes, I've noticed, and I think it's very bad they do.  > I don't have access to all these browsers and their older versions, so how am I supposed to know 
> if things work?

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Not really. I did some reading on specific semantic elements like the [nav element](http://html5doctor.com/nav-element/), and I'm reading through some of the stuff linked on the outlining article, but I haven't gotten through it all.
