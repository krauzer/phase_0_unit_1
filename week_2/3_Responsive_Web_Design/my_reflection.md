# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

> Responsive web design is tayloring a web page so that it can be rendered in any browser of any 
> shape or size. It is different from making individual sites for different sized devices, which is 
> becoming unsustainable as more devices become prevalent. 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

> I think it's changed the web significantly, possibly not for the better. I've noticed sites have >> placed a lot more emphasis on scrollability. Maybe this is because a lot of the frameworks are in 
> use, but there is a lot of repetition. Shouldn't we try to become more diverse in presentation? I 
> think technology will continue to improve design but there will be a lot of dead ends. Already I 
> see a lot of these interactive websites, which look cool but also kind of kitschy. Do people go 
> back to them? A lot of the popular sites (like reddit) maintain a fundamental design. Some people 
> prefer that. Change for change's sake isn't a good idea. 


* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them

> I imagine the visually impared use screen readers to use the web. Of course we should design and 
> develop for them. Desigining for them helps you think about structure too probably. A screen 
> reader must follow the logic. A developer who works within the bounds of web development logic 
> will be better suited to help the impared!. 



* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

> The concept of responsiveness. I never understood media queries all that well, but maybe that's 
> because I never had all that good of a resource to learn from. The structure is very 
> understandable. I also realized how much pseudo-selectors can help when it comes to responsiveness
> . The more specific you can get, the more control you have over fine changes that make a big 
> difference in different browsers.  

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Yes. I read the [MDN site](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag) on the viewport meta tag. Also, the MDN site on [media queries](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries). References on pseudo-selectors helped too.
