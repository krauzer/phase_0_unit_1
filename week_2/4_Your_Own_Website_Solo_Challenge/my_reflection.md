# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://krauzer.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
> I learned you have to think about each before you implement anything. A good-looking site isn't 
> necessarily the most user friendly either. I also learned that each are bigger fields than I had  > imagined and there are a ton of resources available.  



* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

> I love design. Design is like writing for me. Imagining things and then having to implement them  > indirectly (in this case via html and css, writing with text). It was fun working on my site but  > got frustrating as I couldn't get everything I wanted to done. I need to learn more techniques    > and some Javascript and CSS animations to get it done. My original idea had to be scrapped even,  > but the current design came out of it, so it was a good experience overall. I don't really like   > user experience. Seems like another thing to worry about. I'd rather keep it incorporated as part > of design. Good design is good user experience. I can see flaws in my design that directly        > translate to flaws related to user experience. I don't have to think about it seperately. Design, > to me, is fundamentally about how something is perceived. A good perception leads to a good user  > experience. 


* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

> My process was to think about what I wanted to get done. What I had to offer and the personality  > I wanted to present. I came up with a rough idea and I built around that. I came up with a good   > design, but I couldn't get it done so I changed it around. I built around that new idea, and had  > to make some changes. It started to get bulky so I took a break. I have some more to do, but I    > need to figure out how to keep it from being unwieldy. An responsive idea I had didn't work       > because it was too close to being an animation, and I don't have the skill to do that yet. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

> A flanking strip around the main box. My original idea was to have roots come from one site and 
> trees on the other, and they grow/retreat as you resize the browser. I'm not sure how to build    > upon what I currently have. 


* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

>The more I added, the more difficult it became. When keeping it simple, it was relatively easy.    > CSS animations are cool, but I haven't had a lot of practice with them. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

> I kept my design simple, basing it off the responsiveness of percentage sizing, so there wasn't
> anything odd in it. No other resources.
