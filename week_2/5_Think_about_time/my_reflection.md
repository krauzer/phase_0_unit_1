# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
 
>     I think I face two time management challenges. The first is properly allocating the adequate 
> amount of time for studying each topic covered. The second is dealing with distraction. They are  > somewhat related in that stem from trying to retain information, but lead to different results. I >usually either move pretty slowly, trying to focus on each topic for as much time possible or I 
> rush through things because I want to cover everything. I have always been a big procrastinator   > as well because I don't mind working in large stints of time, but I've been improving in that     > area.                                                     										> 	I'm also pretty slow at a lot of things I do, from driving around, to cooking, to working and   > writing. One of the ways I've dealt with the anxiety and heavy workloads is taking on a more laid > back/casual approach to things, and it's good for some things like removing procrastination and   > working late into the night, but I don't think it'll be all that great for DBC.  


* How will you combat that? 

> 	I think I'm going look over every week's work and find the central theme. Then I'm going to     > look for the one project that really captures all the elements covered and dedicate a substantial > amount of time to that exercise. I'm still going to put in time for the other exercises, but I'm  > going to look at them as building blocks to a bigger project, so I don't spend too much time on   > them. 																							>	I'm also going to try to work on my computer productivity maximizing all of the key shortcuts I > can. I've never really cared about this, but it's something I should get a hold on now.  


* What techniques will you try?

> I'll continue with meditation, and start using the Fogg Method. I already have a couple of things > that could be put into use with it. I don't think short stints work for me because I've become    > accustomed to working over longer periods of time, and I don't mind it. Also, I doubt there will  > be many short stints at DBC, so fitting things around larger chunks with the Fogg Method and      > developing a better mindset via meditation is a more realistic goal for me. 


* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

> I wish I could say something more, but I think my overall plan is still to cram like hell, and    > make lifestyle changes that keep my energy up. One thing I worry about for DBC is dealing with    > the hot weather, spending the majority of the day at DBC, and possibly having less time to eat    > well and exercise. I'm hoping to modify things, so the nature of DBC won't put me in a bad place  > healthwise. So the lifestyle changes are the important parts.
